Python (Backend programming Language), Django (Backend Framework), REACT (FrontEnd Framework), Javascript, Node.js (Server Side JavaScript runtime), HTML, tailwind CSS, Postgres (Database), Postman, and Figma(Only for wireframes without Dev Mode). We can also say that we use Python-Django stack.  </br>

<h2>MVP Goals</h2>
Full CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) Functionality. </br>
Login and Logout access for users   </br>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
Please click the back button of the browser to go back to previous page. Refresh the page.   </br>

<h2>Forthcoming Features</h2>
In the future, we need users to be able to give access to family members so that the documents can be viewed by others. In addition, I need to learn Angular (FrontEnd Framework) and do this same app with it.
